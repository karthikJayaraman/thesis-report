\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}
There is an estimated 200,000 hospital acquired infections (HAI) each year in Australia \cite{ausHAI}. This is a major cause for concern Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients who are highly susceptible to cross infection. Therefore, this thesis aims to tackle the issue of HAIs among CF patients receiving out-patient care by developing an indoor real time locating system (RTLS). The collected mobility data on CF patients will be utilised to determine risk areas for cross infection by social network analysis (SNA).

This document presents a progress report. A literature review of the current state of indoor RTLS technology and SNA techniques was performed. Using this research, preliminary steps were taken to design the RTLS software along with experiments. The experiments were designed to aid in the creation of a robust and accurate indoor positioning system. Finally, this document concludes with an outline consisting of planned activities.
